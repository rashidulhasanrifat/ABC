	                              <p class="lead text-center ">Most veterinarians treat parvovirus with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. In addition, treatment may include balancing the blood sugar, intravenous electrolytes, intravenous nourishment, and an antiemetic injection to reduce nausea and vomiting. None of these treatments “cure” the disease or kill the virus; they are supportive therapies that help stabilize the dog long enough for his immune system to begin counteracting the virus.Many dogs diagnosed with parvovirus receive the fate of “economic euthanasia” because their guardians cannot afford treatment. Standard parvovirus treatment necessitates round-the-clock veterinary attention, which means hospitalization.</p>

To protect their adult dogs, pet owners should be sure that their dog's parvovirus vaccination is up-to-date.</p>
